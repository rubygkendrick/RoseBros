## Usage Notes:

#### User Registration and Login:

Ensure that you register a new user account before attempting to log in.
Admin access requires specific credentials, which can be configured in the backend.

#### Database Setup:

Make sure the PostgreSQL database is running and correctly configured.
The connection string should be set in the user-secrets as described in the installation instructions.

#### Running the Application:

Use dotnet watch run --launch-profile https to start the backend.
Use npm run dev to start the frontend.
Both servers need to be running simultaneously for full functionality.

#### Admin Features:

Admin users can add new roses to the inventory and manage orders.
Make sure to log in with an admin account to access these features.



## Reflection
In this capstone project, I developed a full-stack application using C# with .NET Core and Entity Framework Core (EF Core) for the backend, 
and React with React-Strap for the frontend. User authentication and authorization were key components; 
I implemented secure user access, and differentiated roles for regular users and administrators, allowing admins to manage inventory and orders.

Working on this project, I faced challenges such as setting up secure user authentication, managing state in the frontend, and ensuring data consistency 
between client and server. These experiences improved my technical skills and deepened my understanding of full-stack development. I look forward to getting 
more comfortable building these applications, and writing more detailed PRs, even when working by myself.
